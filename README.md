# Hackathon

web-based platform for offering and accepting small jobs around a local area. the jobs can be house cleaning or lawnmowing


To start go to the frontend directory. if node modules isnt already installed enter "npm install" into the terminal to get all required modules.

Run the program by typing npm start or node server.js

Features:
    the website show available jobs in the middle of the screen. the jobs are from our firebase database and are automatically updatated as new jobs become available. normally you would be able to add jobs that you want but currently there is an infinte loop that prevents the job from being added to the datanbase.
